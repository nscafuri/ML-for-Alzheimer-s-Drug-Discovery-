In this project, our objective is to gather bioactive data for drug-like inhibitor molecules targeting the Beta amyloid A4 protein from the ChEMBL database. 
We will employ various techniques, including calculating molecular and Lipinski descriptors, as well as molecular fingerprints. Additionally, 
we aim to construct Machine Learning models based on QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) to predict the bioactivity data of unknown molecules.
